# Teardown-Scripting-Utilities

A collection of helper functions based on presets and preset creation/management.

The objective of this framework is to make it easier for new scripters to be able to easily and conveniently implement functionalities such as particle systems, projectile systems, physics systems, timers and so on since the base requires the scripter to do it all manually.

This framework also includes general helper functions for smaller scripting actions like converting between Quats to normalized directions, raycasting from transforms, in-game debug functions and so on.
